# INN Hotels Booking Cancellation – Classification Project

## Project Overview
This supervised learning project aimed to predict hotel booking cancellations using real-world data from the hospitality sector. I implemented and evaluated two core classification models — **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree Classifier** — with a focus on model interpretability, threshold tuning, and actionable business recommendations.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand booking behavior.
- Identified strong predictors of cancellation: `lead_time`, `avg_price_per_room`, `repeated_guest`.
- Used visual tools such as bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps to uncover insights.

---

## Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Treated missing values and detected outliers (without removal due to model robustness).
- Created dummy variables for categorical features using one-hot encoding.
- Performed stratified train/test split to preserve class balance.

## Model Building & Evaluation

### Logistic Regression
- Built using `statsmodels`; checked for multicollinearity (VIF) and p-values.
- Initially skipped odds interpretation — added later as part of reflection.
- Tuned classification threshold based on F1-score optimization.

### Decision Tree Classifier
- Built and evaluated:
  - Unpruned Tree
  - Pre-pruned Tree (via GridSearchCV)
  - Post-pruned Tree (via Cost Complexity Pruning with `ccp_alpha`)
- Compared performance based on F1, precision, recall, and accuracy.

## Business Insights & Recommendations
- Bookings with longer `lead_time`, no special requests, or by new guests were more likely to cancel.
- Suggested loyalty pricing, lead-time-based refund strategies, and prioritizing reliable segments.
- Emphasized model transparency with visualizations of decision paths and feature importances.

## Reflection & Learnings
- Learned how to tune thresholds, evaluate pruning strategies, and interpret classification outputs.
- Gained confidence in comparing multiple models and selecting the best based on business needs.
- This was my **first end-to-end classification project** — more advanced than linear regression, and highly engaging.
