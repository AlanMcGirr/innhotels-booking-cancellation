This project predicts the probability of a hotel booking being canceled, along with confidence scores and actionable recommendations.
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using supervised learning techniques. By analyzing booking-related data, we aim to identify key factors that influence cancellations and recommend actionable strategies to reduce them.

---

## Dataset
The dataset was provided as part of the **INN Hotels case study** in the UT DSBA program.

- **Target Variable:** `booking_status` (0 = Not Canceled, 1 = Canceled)
- **Features:** Guest details, booking preferences, room types, price, lead time, etc.
- **Size:** ~36,000 rows

---

## Solution Approach

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection and removal
- Class imbalance observation
- Feature transformation and engineering

### Modeling Techniques
- **Logistic Regression**
  - Evaluated using ROC-AUC, F1, and confusion matrix
  - Checked for multicollinearity using VIF
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
  - Unpruned, pre-pruned (hyperparameter tuning), and post-pruned (cost complexity pruning)
  - Compared performance using F1 and recall

### ‚öôÔ∏è Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Recall (important for capturing cancellations)
- Precision
- F1 Score

## Key Results

| Model            | F1 Score (Test) | Recall (Test) | Accuracy (Test) |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Logistic Regression | 79.6%         | 81%           | 86.5%           |
| Decision Tree (Post-Pruned) | 79.5%     | 81%           | 86.5%           |

- **Selected Model:** Post-Pruned Decision Tree
- **Why:** Simple, interpretable, similar performance, and easier to deploy

---

## Business Recommendations
- Offer incentives for high lead-time bookings to reduce cancellations
- Focus on bookings with special requests ‚Äî these tend to cancel less
- Reconsider pricing strategies for `Room_Type 1` and specific meal plans
