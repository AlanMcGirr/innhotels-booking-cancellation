## Key Learnings from the INN Hotels Classification Project

### Project Overview
This supervised learning project focused on predicting hotel booking cancellations using classification models. I built and evaluated both **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** models on a real-world hotel dataset. The project emphasized model interpretability, threshold tuning, and actionable insights for the hospitality sector.

### Technical Skills Gained

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to understand customer behavior.
- Identified key variables such as `lead_time`, `avg_price_per_room`, and `repeated_guest` as strong predictors of cancellations.
- Used visualizations (bar plots, box plots, heatmaps) to derive insights and inform model decisions.

#### âš™Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- Handled missing values, detected outliers, and created dummy variables for categorical features.
- Split data into train/test sets with stratification to maintain class balance.

#### Model Building & Evaluation
- Built a **Logistic Regression model** using `statsmodels` with VIF and p-value analysis to assess feature relevance.
- Tuned classification threshold for Logistic Regression based on F1-score optimization.
- Constructed multiple **Decision Trees** (unpruned, pre-pruned, post-pruned) using `sklearn`, followed by:
  - Cost Complexity Pruning (`ccp_alpha`)
  - Cross-validation for alpha selection
  - Model comparison based on F1, precision, recall, and accuracy

### Business Impact & Interpretability
- Generated insights for hotel management: cancellations were strongly linked to longer lead times, non-repeated guests, and higher room prices.
- Offered **policy recommendations** such as flexible pricing for repeat guests and lead-time-based refund strategies.
- Prioritized **model transparency** by visualizing all trees and comparing feature importances.

### Areas of Improvement (**Reflection**)
- Initially overlooked removing insignificant variables in Logistic Regression and interpreting odds ratios.
- Threshold tuning was completed later and should have been integrated earlier into the modeling flow.
- Learned to better sequence modeling steps and ensure early inclusion of all rubric items.

### Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels
- **Jupyter Notebook** for model development and commentary
