🏨 INN Hotels Booking Cancellation – Classification Project

📌 Project Overview

This supervised learning project aimed to predict hotel booking cancellations using real-world data from the hospitality sector. I implemented and evaluated two core classification models — Logistic Regression and Decision Trees — with a focus on model interpretability, threshold tuning, and actionable business recommendations.

⸻
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to understand booking behavior.
	•	Identified strong predictors of cancellation: lead_time, avg_price_per_room, repeated_guest.
	•	Used visual tools (bar plots, box plots, heatmaps) to uncover key data trends.

⸻

🧹 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
	•	Treated missing values and outliers.
	•	Created dummy variables for categorical features.
	•	Stratified train/test split to preserve class distribution.

⚙️ Model Building & Evaluation

Logistic Regression
	•	Built using statsmodels, checked VIFs and p-values to assess multicollinearity and feature relevance.
	•	Initially skipped odds interpretation — later noted as a learning point.
	•	Tuned classification threshold based on F1-score optimization.

Decision Tree Classifier
	•	Built and evaluated:
	•	Unpruned Tree
	•	Pre-pruned Tree (via GridSearchCV)
	•	Post-pruned Tree (via Cost Complexity Pruning, ccp_alpha)
	•	Compared models using F1, precision, recall, and accuracy scores.

⸻

📈 Business Insights & Recommendations
	•	Cancellations were more likely from:
	•	Customers with longer lead times
	•	First-time bookers
	•	High room price segments
	•	Recommended flexible refund policies, loyalty-based pricing, and early detection alerts.
	•	Visualized all trees and emphasized interpretability for stakeholder trust.

⸻

🧠 Key Learnings & Reflection
	•	Logistic Regression: Forgot to remove insignificant predictors and interpret odds initially.
	•	Threshold Tuning: Completed late; in future, integrate earlier in the modeling pipeline.
	•	Model Sequencing: Learned to align steps better with business questions and rubric expectations.
	•	Gained hands-on confidence with pruning techniques and model performance tuning.

⸻

🛠 Tools & Libraries
	•	Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, statsmodels
	•	Platform: Jupyter Notebook for code, markdown explanations, and visual output.
